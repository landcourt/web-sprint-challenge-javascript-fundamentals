Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

The four rules of the 'this' keyword are default binding, which refers to how 'this' is the global context whenever a function is invoked without any of the other rules. Implicit binding which occurs when dot notation is used to invoke a function. Whatever is to the left of 'this'. Explicit binding which occurs when you explicitly pass in a 'this' context to .call(), .apply(), or .bind() which you'd use on a function. And last but not least there's new binding that refers to the new object created when applied.
